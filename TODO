- Create a 'scenery' module that will, for each component :
  - Hold definitions
  - Setup standard Renderer
  - Regroup load/save/render (from auto)
- Merge all Quality and Environment, as one Renderer.
- No more _definition, _quality, _environment in components.
- All component methods become custom.
- Refactor fog in a new 'atmosphere' module.
- In GUI, revertConfig should lock the previews while reverting.
- All Save and Load methods should have same signature : void ...Save(FILE*, ...*)
- All noises should use the same entropy pool (saved separately), and avoid reallocs.
- Remove all global variables (render_quality, render_width...), it should all be set in Renderer.
