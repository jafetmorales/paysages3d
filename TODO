Technology Preview 2 :
- Add initial terrain offset so that the (0,0) coordinates are above water (to avoid starting at the middle of a sea).
- Use water height as 0.0 (offset the terrain).
- Add missing cloud models.
- Finish material dialog.
- Finish texture dialog.
- Fix rendering when inside a cloud layer, with other upper or lower layers.
- Fix the moon being backlit by its own light.
- Translations.

Technlogy Preview 3 :
- FOCUS : Streamlining, with undo system
- FOCUS : Vegetation
- Implement copy-on-write on definitions (to avoid copying whole heightmaps for instance).
- Alter aerial perspective using estimation of the amount of light left after cloud layers traversal.
- Add a map preview to terrain editor.
- Better time selection widget for atmosphere.
- Clouds should keep distance to ground.
- Fully move layer management from BaseForm to BaseFormLayer.
- Allow render saving in HDR compatible format.
- Add clouds to explorer with 3d textures.
- Add fresnel effect to specular lighting.
- Add shadow control ("minimum lighting") to material.
- Start using OpenCL to optimize rendering.
- Fully restore render progress (with first pass).
- Rethink the quality settings and detail smoothing in the distance.
   => When quality setting is set to 10, add boost options
   => Add detail boost (adds granularity)
   => Add step boost (for marching algorithms)
- Add logarithmic sliders for some float values.
- Improve previews.
   => Add user markers on OSD.
   => Add areas marking.
- Add a noise automatic filler.
- Lock some previews together (eg: terrain height and colored preview).
- Find a new licence.

Technology Preview 4 :
- Implement Sub Surface Scattering for water, textures and clouds.
- Implement earth curvature.
- Use bicubic interpolation for antialiasing.
- Allow for larger renders/antialias (will need several two-pass chunks).
- Add a progress indicator on previews.
- Mark modified tabs and ask for losing modifications (idem for layers).
- Fix potential holes in land rendering.
- Progressive final render (increasing resolution, for second pass only).
- Improve 3d explorer
   => Restore LOD and intelligent poly count (and raise max tessellation)
   => Better handling of high altitude
   => Interrupt chunk rendering when quitting dialog
   => Don't display the water if it's below all ground
   => Try to overcome the near frustum cutting
   => Add toggles (for water...)
   => Max texture size should depend on GPU memory available
- Interrupt preview chunk renderings that will be discarded at commit, or that are no more visible.

Release Candidate :
- Polish all features and UI.
- More translations.
