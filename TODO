- Clouds are lighted without filtering from ground (clouds lighted at night !)
- Camera should respect ratio aspect of render area.
- All noises should use the same entropy pool (saved separately), and avoid reallocs.
- Implement light multi-sampling (mainly for skydome).
- Remove all global variables (render_quality, render_width...), it should all be set in Renderer.
- Implement scaling and scrolling on previews.
- Water and terrain LOD moves with the camera, fix it like in the wanderer.
