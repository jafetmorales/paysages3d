About
-----

[Paysages 3D](http://www.paysages3d.com) is a work-in-progress landscape generator, modeler and renderer software.

It is written in C++ 11, using Qt 5.2 as only dependency.

Build/Run
---------

At the moment, the build system is only well tested using the latest [QtSDK](http://qt-project.org/downloads) installation, and [QtCreator](http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-creator). Later work will remove this dependency.

Simply open the *src/paysages.pro* file in QtCreator, and make a shadow build.

You can then run the compiled program **from the top project directory** (the one that contains *src* and *data*).
